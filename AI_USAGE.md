# AI Usage Documentation

This document outlines how AI tools(Chatgpt and Copilot) were used during the development of the FoodRunner application.

## Where AI Was Used

- **Google Maps Integration:** Assisted in location tracking, polyline drawing for routes, and Directions API integration for navigation.
- **Driver Assignment Algorithm:** Assisted in proximity-based driver matching system with distance calculations and scoring logic.
- **Real-time Tracking:** Assisted in StreamBuilder patterns for live order updates and driver location tracking during deliveries.
- **UI/UX Development:** Assisted in implementing responsive layouts, reusable widgets, and Material Design implementations across all screens.
- **Data Models:** Assisted in Dart model classes with toMap() and fromFirestore() serialization methods for all entities.
- **Location Services:** Assisted in permission handling, background tracking, and geocoding service for address conversion.
- **Code Refactoring:** Suggested service layer separation, identified code duplication, and recommended better naming conventions.
- **Debugging:** Helped resolve complex issues like the driver assignment race condition and location tracking problems.

## Important Notes
- Application architecture and feature design decisions were made independently
- AI was used as a learning tool to accelerate development, not replace understanding
